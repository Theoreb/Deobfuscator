# Deobfuscator
A python deobfuscator that use various librairies to rename variables and function in javascript code using local fast LLM (provided by ollama)

It provides the LLM with some context about the code and perform the modifications on the code.

The code itself is pure spaghetti and was coded in some hours so feel free to modify it !
